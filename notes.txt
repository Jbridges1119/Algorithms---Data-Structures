DATA STRUCTURE
- organize with optimal 'runetime complexity' for modifying records


QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE
- like a line(queued up)
- FIFO (First one in(longest in queue) - first one out) 
- can use an array but limit access to front(unshift - add to left) and end(pop - remove right) modification only
